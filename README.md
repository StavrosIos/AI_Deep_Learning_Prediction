# AI_Deep_Learning_Prediction

The goal of this report is to create a Neural Network model that can generate text in the form of online news articles 
To achieve this a suitable dataset is needed. The dataset should be comprised of different online articles written by journalists.
 The BBC dataset available at {http://mlg.ucd.ie/datasets/bbc.html} holds 2225 documents from the BBC website, published between 2004 and 2005
From the five categories available, the ones that were chosen are sports and technology.
Thus the RNN will be tasked with finding a way to produce news articles on the topic of sports and technology.

Model architectures used:
A word-level RNN (LSTM)
A character-level RNN (LSTM)
A character-level GRU.
All models also employ an embedding layer so that the text is represented in vectors of fixed sizes.
Their performance is compared against each other. The text generated by the models is analyzed  in terms of loss and perplexity.
